# Development of nighttime fatigue driving detection technology using infrared images
## Inroduction
This project discusses the nighttime IR image fatigue driving detection based on slowfast, in the following will describe how this project work, what and how dataset is used.

## Abstract
Traffic safety accidents are one of the top ten causes of death, with fatigue
driving accounting for a large proportion of them. Fatigue can cause reduced
concentration and reaction speed, and there are many occupations that often
drive at night because of their occupational needs, for example, long-haul
truck drivers, cab drivers, and so on are high-risk groups.
Therefore, to avoid accidents caused by fatigue driving, this paper proposes a real-time driving fatigue monitoring system, which uses a car recorder
image to capture the driving image, uses a deep learning model to capture the
driverâ€™s head image and builds an abnormal event detection model to determine whether the driver has abnormal behavior due to fatigue and gives a
reminder to avoid accidents.
Therefore, this paper collects a series of IR images in the car at night and
annotates them according to the format of Kinectis data set.
